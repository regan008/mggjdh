Mapping the Gay Guides (MGG) relies on Bob Damron’s Address Books, an early but longstanding travel guide aimed at gay men since the early 1960s. An LGBTQ equivalent to the African American “green books,” the Damron Guides contained lists of bars, bathhouses, cinemas, businesses, hotels, and cruising sites in every U.S. state, where gay men could find friends, companions, and sex. Through both an online interactive map and an open access dataset, Mapping the Gay Guides provides tools for scholars to study queer history on a new scale. This article uses the Journal of Digital History’s unique and innovative format to discuss the guides as historical sources, the methods used to create the dataset, and then demonstrates the ways in which computational methods can be used to explore aspects of this large dataset.
